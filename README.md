It is a project, which has customers (consumers) and shops. It is written in node.js,express.js and react.js. The data is stored in the PostgreSQL database using sequelize. The communication protocols are the rest but it also has web sockets for real-time communication between the consumer and the store when creating an order. There is no emphasis on style and front-end, which will be added later.
